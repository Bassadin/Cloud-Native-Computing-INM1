# Task 09

- Using the npm mongodb package for using MongoDB
- Environment variable handling with node.js seems a little more difficult...
  - Actually, env variables from kubernetes can be passed directly into node's .env!
    - Which makes it rather easy to access
- Using [https://www.postman.com/](Postman) for test requests
  - Support for local and dev environments with different urls and such
